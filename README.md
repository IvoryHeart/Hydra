Hydra: Hypermedia-Driven Web APIs
==============

Hydra is a lightweight vocabulary to create hypermedia-driven Web APIs.
By specifying a number of concepts commonly used in Web APIs it it makes it
possible to build generic API clients.

To participate in the development of this specification please file bugs and
issues in the issue tracker.

***This is highly experimental stuff that isn't ready yet for production use yet.***
