  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Coping with the ever-increasing amount of data becomes
    increasingly challenging. To alleviate the information overload put on
    people, systems are progressively being connected directly to each
    other. They exchange, analyze, and manipulate humongous amounts of
    data without any human interaction. Most current solutions, however,
    do not exploit the whole potential of the architecture of the World
    Wide Web and completely ignore the possibilities offered by Linked Data
    technologies.</p>

  <p>The combination of the REST architectural style and the Linked
    Data principles offer opportunities to advance the Web of machines
    in a similar way that hypertext did for the human Web. Most
    building blocks exist already and are in place but they are rarely
    used together. Hydra tries to fill that gap. It allows data to be
    enriched with machine-readable affordances which enable
    interaction. This not only addresses the problem that Linked Data
    is still mostly read-only, but it also paves the way for a
    completely new breed of interoperable Web APIs. The fact that it
    enables the creation of composable contracts means that
    interaction models of Web APIs can be reused at an unprecedented
    granularity.</p>

  <h2>Conformance</h2>

  <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for
    <dfn title="Hydra API documentation">Hydra API documentations</dfn>
    and <dfn title="Hydra client">Hydra clients</dfn>. This criteria is
    relevant to authors, authoring tool implementers, and client
    implementers. All authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
    in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections
    explicitly marked as non-normative. Everything else in this
    specification is normative.</p>

  <p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
    SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this
    specification have the meaning defined in [[!RFC2119]].</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Hydra at a Glance</h2>

  <p>The basic idea behind Hydra is to provide a vocabulary which enables a
    server to advertise valid state transitions to a client. A client can
    then use this information to construct HTTP requests which modify the
    server’s state so that a certain desired goal is achieved. Since all
    the information about the valid state transitions is exchanged in a
    machine-processable way at runtime instead of being hardcoded into the
    client at design time, clients can be decoupled from the server and
    adapt to changes more easily.</p>

  <p>The figure below illustrates the Hydra core vocabulary (the figure’s
    intention is to show how Hydra is used rather than its precise
    definition).</p>

  <p class="issue">Is this illustration clear enough or is it confusing?
    Feedback would be much appreciated.</p>

    given below. All the terms are hyperlinked to their detailed
    description for quick reference.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Using Hydra</h2>

  <p>Throughout this section, a simple Web API featuring an issue tracker
    will be used to illustrate how Hydra can be used. The Web API enables
    its users to file new issues, modify or delete existing ones, and
    to comment them. For the sake of simplicity, orthogonal aspects such
    as authentication or authorization are not covered.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Adding Affordances to Representations</h3>

    <p>The exemplary Web API has to expose representations of issues and
      comments. To enable interaction with those resources, a client has
      to know which operations the server supports. In human-facing
      websites such affordances are typically exposed by links and forms
      and described in natural language. Unfortunately, machines can not
      interpret such information easily. The solution that presents itself
      is to reduce the language to a small number of unambiguous concepts
      which are easily recognizable by a machine client. Hydra formalizes
      such concepts.</p>

    <p>The following example illustrates how representations can be
      augmented with information that enables clients to interact with
      them. A client would be able to understand that the resource in
      the example below can be deleted by sending an HTTP DELETE
      request.</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="A representation of an issue">
      <!--
      {
        ****"@context": "http://purl.org/hydra/core/context.jsonld"****,
        "@id": "/an-issue",
        "title": "An exemplary issue representation",
        "description": "This issue can be deleted with an HTTP DELETE request"
        ****"operations"****: [
          ****{
            "@type": "DeleteResourceOperation",
            "method": "DELETE"
          }****
        ]
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>The example above references Hydra's context to map properties such
      as <code>operations</code> and <code>method</code> and values like
      <code>DeleteResourceOperation</code> to URLs that unambiguously
      identify these concepts. It would be similarly valid JSON-LD if
      these mappings would be directly embedded into the representation
      or if the full URLs would be used instead. Typically, however, the
      context is the same for a lot of representations in a Web API and
      it thus makes sense to reduce the response size by leveraging a
      remote context that can easily be cached by a client.</p>

    <p>In Hydra, an <i>Operation</i> represents the information necessary
      for a client to construct valid HTTP requests in order to manipulate
      the server’s resource state. As such, the only required property of
      an <i>Operation</i> is its HTTP <i>method</i>. Optionally, it is
      also possible to describe what information the server <i>expects</i>
      or <i>returns</i>, including additional information about HTTP
      status codes that might be returned. This helps a developer to
      understand what to expect when invoking an operation. This
      information has, however, not to be considered as being complete;
      it is merely a hint. Developers should, e.g., expect that other
      HTTP status codes might be returned and program their clients
      accordingly.</p>

    <p>Hydra has three predefined operation classes, namely
      <i>CreateResourceOperation</i>, <i>ReplaceResourceOperation</i>,
      and <i>DeleteResourceOperation</i>. As their names suggest, they
      can be used to implement simple
      <abbr title="Create, replace, update, and delete">CRUD</abbr>
      functionality. More specialized operations can be easily created
      by subclassing these classes or their base class <i>Operation</i>.</p>

    <p class="issue">Describe Resource, Link, Templated Link and perhaps
      also Operations here.</p>

    <h3>Documenting a Web API</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Accessing a Hydra-powered Web API</h3>

    <p>The first step when trying to access a Web API is to find an entry
      point. Typically, this is done by looking for documentation on the
      API publisher's homepage. Hydra enables the API's main entry point
      to be discovered automatically if the API publisher marks his
      responses with a special HTTP Link Header as defined in [[RFC5988]].
      A Hydra client would look a Link Header with a relation type
      <code>http://purl.org/hydra/core#apiDocumentation</code> (this is
      the IRI identifying the <i>hydra:apiDocumentation</i> property).</p>

    <p>In the following example, a Hydra client simply accesses the
      homepage of an API publisher, <code>http://www.example.com</code>
      to find the entry point of its API. A client may use an HTTP GET or
      HEAD request. The difference between the two is that the former may
      return a message-body in the response whereas the latter will not;
      otherwise they are identical.</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Discovering Hydra API documentation documents">
      <!--
      HEAD / HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.example.com

      ====================================

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      Content-Type: application/ld+json
      ****Link: <http://api.example.com/doc/>;
            rel="http://purl.org/hydra/core#apiDocumentation"****
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>The response in the example above contains an HTTP Link Header
      pointing to <code>http://api.example.com/doc/api.jsonld</code>.
      Retrieving that resource, the client would obtain a
      <a>Hydra API documentation</a> defining the API's main entry
      point:</p>

    <pre class="example" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Retrieving a Hydra API documentation to obtain the main entry point">
      <!--
      GET /doc/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.example.com
      Accept: application/ld+json,application/json,*/*;q=0.1

      ====================================

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      Content-Type: application/ld+json

      {
        "@context": "context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/api/doc/",
        "title": "The example.com API",
        ****"entrypoint": "http://api.example.com/"****,
        ...
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>Please note that in most cases the entry point will already be
      known to the client. Thus, the discovery of the API documentation
      using HTTP Link Headers is typically not necessary as the concepts
      used in responses from the API will dereference to their
      documentation.</p>

    <h3>Using Hydra Descriptions as JSON</h3>

    <p class="issue">The are multiple ways to serialize a
      <a>Hydra API documentation</a> in JSON-LD. To make it usable also for
      plain-old JSON clients, the serialization has to have a deterministic
      shape. The definition of a profile will make it possible to signal
      or request specific serialization conventions at the media type
      level. The definition of the profile might be as simple as defining
      a JSON-LD frame.</p>
