  <p>Hydra is a lightweight vocabulary to create hypermedia-driven Web APIs.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Coping with the ever-increasing amount of data becomes
    increasingly challenging. To alleviate the information overload put on
    people, systems are progressively being connected directly to each
    other. They exchange, analyze, and manipulate humongous amounts of
    data without any human interaction. Most current solutions, however,
    do not exploit the whole potential of the architecture of the World
    Wide Web and completely ignore the possibilities offered by Linked Data
    technologies.</p>

  <p>The combination of the REST architectural style and the Linked
    Data principles offer opportunities to advance the Web of machines
    in a similar way that hypertext did for the human Web. Most
    building blocks exist already and are in place but they are rarely
    used together. Hydra tries to fill that gap. It allows data to be
    enriched with machine-readable affordances which enable
    interaction. This not only addresses the problem that Linked Data
    is still mostly read-only, but it also paves the way for a
    completely new breed of interoperable Web APIs. The fact that it
    enables the creation of composable contracts means that
    interaction models of Web APIs can be reused at an unprecedented
    granularity.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>

    <p>This document is aimed at both Web API publishers (those involved in
      maintaining, administering and hosting datasets), and Web API consumers
      (those involved in finding, querying, crawling and indexing datasets).</p>

    <p>Readers of this document should be familiar with the core concepts of
      RDF [RDF-PRIMER] and RDF Schema [RDFS]. Knowledge of the Turtle syntax [TURTLE]
      for RDF is required to read the examples. Some knowledge of widely-used
      vocabularies (Dublin Core [DC], Friend of a Friend [FOAF]) is also assumed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Document conventions</h2>

    <p>The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
      SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
      interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].

    <p>All examples in this document are written in JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]].
      Throughout the document, the following prefixes are used:</p>

  <h2>Conformance</h2>

  <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for
    <dfn title="Hydra API description">Hydra API descriptions</dfn> and
    <dfn title="Hydra client">Hydra clients</dfn>. This criteria is
    relevant to authors, authoring tool implementers, and client
    implementers. All authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
    in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections
    explicitly marked as non-normative. Everything else in this
    specification is normative.</p>

  <p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
    SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this
    specification have the meaning defined in [[!RFC2119]].</p>

  <h2>Hydra at a Glance</h2>

  <p>The basic idea behind Hydra is to provide a vocabulary which enables a
    server to advertise valid state transitions to a client. A client can
    then use this information to construct HTTP requests which modify the
    server’s state so that a certain desired goal is achieved. Since all
    the information about the valid state transitions is exchanged in a
    machine-processable way at runtime instead of being hardcoded into the
    client at design time, clients can be decoupled from the server and
    adapt to changes more easily.</p>

  <p>The figure below illustrates the Hydra core vocabulary (the figure’s
    intention is to show how Hydra is used rather than its precise
    definition).</p>
